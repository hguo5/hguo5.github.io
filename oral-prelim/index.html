				<div class="bodypara-head">Title: Extraction and Inference of Event Pairs in Stories</div>
				<div class="bodypara-text">
				<p>
				<b>Research Theme:</b> 
				A story, in the sense of natural language processing, comprises a sequence of events. 
The relations between pairs of events are the building blocks of a coherent story. 
We consider the <i>inferential relations</i> between events. Two events are <i>inferentially related</i> 
if their sequential order can be inferred by commonsense. 
In certain types of texts, such as app reviews and breach reports, inferentially relations event pairs 
bear particular importance as they can be considered as the take-away messages or lessons learned. 
Their extraction should be deliberately investigated. 
Inference on event pairs and stories can help the understanding and reasoning of stories in important documents. 
This research investigates the extraction and inference of event pairs, in the form of event phrases, 
that are inferentially ordered. We address the importance of extracting such events pairs, how their orders 
can be inferred, and how their inferred orders can facilitate event inference in stories. 
				</p>

				<p>
				<b>Methods:</b> 
				This research (1) develops CASPAR, a method for extracting and analyzing user-reported 
event pairs regarding app problems from app reviews, and (2) proposes EPOCI, the task of 
event pair ordering based on commonsense inference, and its solutions. 
CASPAR collects event pairs that describe (1) user actions and (2) app problems that are 
triggered by the user actions. These event pairs capture the essence of the bug-report type 
of app reviews, and provide information that facilitates developers to maintain and improve 
the app's functionality and user experience. 
To target the EPOCI task, we (1) collect a dataset of event pairs ordered by commonsense 
inference (the EPOCI dataset) through manual annotations, and (2) propose deep learning 
methods for the classification of event pairs based on their inferential orders. 
We report the performance of the proposed methods and necessitate future improvement of the solutions. 
				</p>
        
				<p>
				<b>Claims:</b> 
				CASPAR discovers high-quality event pairs regarding app problems from app reviews. 
By presenting CASPAR, we show that inferentially ordered event pairs capture important information of stories.
Our proposed methods solve the EPOCI task with moderate accuracy. 
We posit that information learned from event pairs can be leveraged for event inference 
in stories with longer sequences of events, which motivates our research plan.
