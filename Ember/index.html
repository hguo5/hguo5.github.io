				<b>Context:</b> The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is legally required to publish details of breaches of protected health information (PHI) affecting 500 or more individuals. 
A report of such a data breach includes actions taken by the responsible party after it, which can inform other parties of how to prevent, mitigate, or recover from similar future breaches. 
				</p>
				<p><b>Objective:</b> Our research aims to aid security analysts and software developers in extracting useful actions from breach reports and suggesting actions based on breach descriptions.
				</p>
				<p><b>Method:</b> To this end, we propose Ember, an automated approach of extracting information from breach reports and suggesting actions based on the extracted knowledge. 
First, Ember identifies informative sentences with a classifier. 
Second, Ember extracts descriptive phrases and useful actions from the informative sentences using NLP techniques. 
Descriptive phrases are words or phrases that describe a breach. 
Useful actions are actions in response to the breach and can be considered as security requirements and lessons learned from the stories. 
Finally, Ember suggests actions based on descriptions of the breach that the responsible party wishes to prevent or remedy. 
				</p>
				<p><b>Results:</b> We apply Ember on 3,144 breach reports and build an action suggestion tool. 
We have conducted a survey to evaluate the effectiveness of Ember and the tool. 
The survey results show that (1) Ember achieves 78\% recall in information extraction, outperforming average humans, and (2) the tool suggests relevant and helpful actions toward HIPAA compliance.
				</p>
				<p><b>Conclusions: </b> Ember is the first work toward automated information extraction from breach reports. 
Ember presents the extracted information in an easy-to-use action suggestion tool, which helps HIPAA-covered entities comply with regulations and protect health information.
